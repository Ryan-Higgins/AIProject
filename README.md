I hope to create a Star-Wars space battle which opens with the classic text crawl outlining what is happening in the Galaxy at the moment of the battle. Then it will be the shot of the star destroyer panning over head while firing at a ship. It will then lead into a large scale space battle with rebel ships and TIE fighters flying around in and out of formation, destroying eachother and attacking the larger ships. This all takes place in the large vast emptiness of space. The ship we saw at the start will jump to lightspace. When it arrives out of lightspace it will see three other star destroyers waiting for it. It will then end.
