# AIProject

I hope to create a Star-Wars space battle which opens with the classic text crawl outlining what is happening in the Galaxy at the moment of the battle. Then it will be the shot of the star destroyer panning over head while firing at a ship. It will then lead into a large scale space battle with rebel ships and TIE fighters flying around in and out of formation, destroying eachother and attacking the larger ships. This all takes place in the large vast emptiness of space. The ship we saw at the start will jump to lightspace. When it arrives out of lightspace it will see three other star destroyers waiting for it. It will then end.

The result is something that is similar to what I described I was going to create. The scene plays out on its own without input. The AI scripts are similar to what was provided but also have been edited to suit the various ships and behaviours that I wanted them to have. There are brains for the cameras, TIEs and X-Wings to control the the scenes. The music is from one of the star wars battlefront games but I thought it suited the video.
