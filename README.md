I hope to create a Star-Wars space battle which opens with the classic shot of the star destroyer panning over head while firing at a ship. It will then lead into a large scale space battle with rebel ships and TIE fighters flying around in and our of formation, destroying eachother and attacking the larger ships. This all takes place in the large vast emptiness of space.
